To install the workflow, open `clip2key.workflow`. This will add an item to the `AppName > Services > General` menu. You can assign a keyboard shortcut to it later using the keyboard shortcut menu to this item.

To type the contents of the keyboard, for example, in Google Chrome, click `Chrome > Services > clip2key`.

You can edit the script though apple's automator app.

Other stuffs
* mac.command is the bash version of the script.

## For Linux
The linux.sh script contains code to paste the content of the clipboard. You can run the script as is or connect it to a menu or keyboard shortcut for convenience.
